That is why he asked us to help him : finding the neighborhood in Toronto which is the most interesting considering both:\n* Presence of potential clients\n* Competition with similar restaurants"

In order to locate the neighborhoods and make Foursquare requests, I will first use the Wikipedia page listing these neighborhoods per postal codes, and Geocoder to get the coordinates I need.\nAs an exemple of the whole process of data collection, let's consider the first neighborhood in the Wikipedia page : Parkwoods. I collect the name and postal code, which I use to find the coordinates of the neighborhood with Geocoder. Then with this postal code I am able to find all the venues nearby thanks to Foursquare's API. This goes right into a dataframe, and I have to repeat the process for all neighborhoods."
